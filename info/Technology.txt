MemSQL doesn't follow the typical NoSQL rules, but that hasn't stopped it from gaining in popularity. Founder Eric Frenkiel recently spoke with TechRepublic about the company's latest moves.
With Google, Facebook, and other big web companies handing out the world's best data infrastructure for free, it has become a truism that all essential data infrastructure is now open source.
Except when it's not.
I spent several years at MongoDB, a leading open source NoSQL database. MongoDB's success has attracted scores of venture-backed market entrants, one of which is MemSQL. Where most of these new NoSQL entrants followed the traditional open source development and business model route, MemSQL moved in a totally different direction. MemSQL's software is (gasp!) not open source and (gasp again!) they embraced SQL. Even so, it keeps managing to grow in popularity, as measured by DB-Engines.
