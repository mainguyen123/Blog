Ride-hailing services might soon be a thing of the past in one Indonesian city.

Tourist-friendly Yogyakarta said all ride-hailing services including Uber, Grab, Go-Jek and Go-Car would soon be banned across the city.

The ban is expected to kick in as soon as this week.

"The regulation is being processed and will be done within a week. We will take action in accordance with the regulation," Yogyakarta Transportation Agency (Kopetayo) Head Gatot Saptadi told the Jakarta Globe on Friday.

The announcement comes following a riot in Yogyakarta earlier last month, with some 300 taxi drivers calling for the ride-sharing apps to be banned.

"Our income has dropped 90 percent. If nothing happens, we will take to the streets again," the coordinator of the Yogyakarta Metered Tai Drivers Community, Sutiman, told the Jakarta Post.

However, Uber and Grab had last year already received the higher Indonesian government's blessing to operate, following a protest which saw 10,000 taxi drivers protest in Jakarta.

This means that Yogyakarta will have to obtain an exception from the Ministry of Transportation to enact their regional ban, according to a Coconuts report.

Back in 2015, the mayor of another Indonesian city, Bandung, banned the use of ride-hailing apps, saying they violated public transportation requirements. 

However, ride-hailing apps appear to still exist in Bandung, with a mob of minivan drivers attacking a suspected Uber car just this month. .
